# TF-MLP-Classifier
The neural network offers learning, testing and saving of the model as well as its subsequent use. 
There is the possibility of oversampling of minority classes using the SMOTE algorithm and estimating 
additional attributes thanks to PolynomialFeatures (note - its use can sometimes worsen results !)
